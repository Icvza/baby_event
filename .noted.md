To satisfy the scope requirment i will create a scope that grabs all of the USERS - BABIES:THIER:EVENTS and allow it to be deleated

SELECT events.* FROM events WHERE event.user_
  INNER JOIN babies ON babies.event_id = event.id
  INNER JOIN customer ON customers.id = babies.id




o


SELECT events.* FROM events
  INNER JOIN users ON users.id = events.user_id
  INNER JOIN babies ON babies.event_id = events.id
